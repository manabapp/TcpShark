# NAME
`tcpshark` - Packet analyzer for TCP troubleshooting

# SYNOPSIS
### list mode

    tcpshark -r <infile> [-H] [-C] [-t a|ad|r] [-p <port>] [-4 | -6 | -a <addr>] [-d] [-y | -f <field>]

### flow mode

    tcpshark -r <infile> -s <index> [-H] [-C] [-t a|ad|dd|e|r|rs] [-v] [-w] [-q] [-y] [-f <field>]

# DESCRIPTION
TcpShark is network analyzing script, powered by Wireshark.  
This utility displays visually TCP stream for ease of analysis.

# HOW TO USE
First, lists TCP streams in **list mode**.

Next, specifies the index of stream and looks over the packet flow in **flow mode**.

In addition, you can analyze as you like by piping the result to `less -R` command.

    $ tcpshark -r tcpdump.pcap -s 0 | less -R

# OPTIONS
- `-r <infile>`  
Reads packet data from infile.  
This utility can analyze the file captured by Wireshark, tcpdump, snoop, etc.

- `-s <index>`  
Displays the specific stream in flow mode.  
If no this option, runs in list mode.

- `-H`  
Omits the header information.

- `-C`  
Displays a result in colorless.  
In default, displays colorfully with ANSI color escape sequences.

- `-t a|ad|dd|e|r|rs`  
Selects the format of the packet timestamp.  
The format can be one of:  
  ||||
  |:--|:--|:--|
  |`a`|absolute time with no date|Default|
  |`ad`|absolute date and time||
  |`dd`|delta time since the previous displayed packet||
  |`e`|epoch time in seconds since Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00||
  |`r`|relative time since the first packet in the capture file||
  |`rs`|relative time since the first packet in the stream||

- `-p <port>`  
Only streams with specified port are displayed.

- `-4`  
Only IPv4 streams are displayed.

- `-6`   
Only IPv6 streams are displayed.

- `-a <addr>`  
Only streams with specified IPv4/v6 address are displayed.

- `-d`  
Streams list is sorted in descending order according to the total number of packets.  
**(Linux use only)**

- `-v`  
Reverses the source and destination.

- `-w`  
Calculated window size is displayed, if scaling.

- `-q`  
Relative sequence numbers and acknowledgement numbers are displayed.  
In default, absolute numbers.

- `-y`  
TCP analysis information is displayed.  
In detail, see "**OUTPUT FORMAT**".

- `-f <field>`  
Specified field is displayed.  
In list mode, statistics information is displayed in each direction.  
About available field, see Wireshark web site.  
https://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/

- `-h`  
Prints this help page.

- `-V`  
Prints the version and exits.

|TCPSHARK_EXECUTION_USER|Execution user name to use instead of root.<br>If you run as root user, TcpShark internally executes tshark as the user specified in this variable.<br>By default, executes tshark as root.|
|TCPSHARK_MAX_STREAMS|Maximum number of streams that can be processed in list mode.<br>Default value is 262144. Upper limit is 1048576.<br>If a huge number of streams in your capture file, set the number of streams or each more.<br>Note that it may require a lot of memory to process huge streams.|
|TCPSHARK_APPEARANCE|TcpShark displays colorfully with ANSI color escape sequences.<br>Selects appearance according to your terminal color from `Dark` or `Light`.<br>Default is `Dark`. If your terminal's background is whitish color, set `Light`.|
